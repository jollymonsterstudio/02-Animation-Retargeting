# Tutorial 2 - How to re-target animations in Unreal

This is the sample project from my video tutorial which you can find here: https://youtu.be/Vf8-UT_xg8A

It shows a few different different things specifically around bringing in new animation assets, from a website like [Mixamo.com](https://www.mixamo.com/#/) and incorporating them into your project.

The project contains two animations sets from Mixamo, one with default transformation settings, the other one lowered in order to fit better with our level. As well as a saved Mixamo rig that you can use for other animations.

Hope this helps, Thanks.
